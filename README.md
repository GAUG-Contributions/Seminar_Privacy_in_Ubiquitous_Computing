Topic: The Protection of Bystanders' Privacy

Abstract: The ubiquitous presence of privacy threatening devices in nowadays’ society is an issue that touches several domains, including economic, social, legal and technological. 
In this report, we present an overview of the situation regarding the privacy of bystanders, a topic that is getting more attention in research due to rising concerns. 
We describe the nature of devices that can threaten the visual, audio, and location privacy of bystanders in various situations: they include smartphones, drones, and, more recently, Internet of Things (IoT) devices such as smart-home devices. 
We then discuss over a number of past attempts at solutions that were unfruitful, before coming to our focus by presenting three technologies that aim to protect the privacy of bystanders. 
We denote two major approaches: one that takes action upon the collection of data (e.g. visual abstraction of bystanders when they are being photographed), one upon the online-sharing of interdependent data. 
The technologies adopting the former approach rely on user participation: bystanders register a privacy profile that is accessed by the system when it recognizes them. 
This gives a necessary flexibility to those systems, because of the different requirements regarding privacy across different individuals. 
The latter approach is perhaps even more crucial, as the sharing of interdependent data without the knowledge or the consent of the implied bystanders can have disastrous consequences. 
The limitations and challenges of the presented technologies are also discussed; the main challenge being the inclusion of such systems in everyday’s life apps and websites, to efficiently start protecting bystanders’ privacy.
